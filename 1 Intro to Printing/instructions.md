# Instructions  

  Welcome to our first Python session.
  Today we are going to explore the
  ```print()``` function a little more using Chapter 1 from our book.

  ## Steps
  1. Print *Hello World* to the terminal
  2. Using your textbook, work through the examples on page 10 and top of page 11.
  3. Add the necessary comments to describe what your code is doing.

## Challenge
  1. Using two ``print()`` functions, write and test the code to display the string *Goodbye!* twice on the same line.
