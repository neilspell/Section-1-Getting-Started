# Flow of Control  

The flow of control refers to the order in which the lines of a computer program are run by the computer. Normally lines are executed in the same sequence in which they appear. This type of flow is called *sequential.* 

We use the following four-line program to illustrate this concept.
````python
print("As I was going out one day")
print("My head fell off and rolled away,")
print("But when I saw that it was gone,")
print("I picked it up and put it on.")
````
When this program is run, execution starts at line 1 which causes the string, As I was going out one day, to be displayed on the output console. Execution then moves sequentially through lines 2, 3 and 4 and finally, the program ends as there are no more lines to execute.

## Predict
1. In your copy, write out what you think the output of the code above will be. 
2. Then compare with your classmate beside you, before typing it into ``main.py``



# Indentation
Indentation refers to the empty space(s) at the beginning of a line of code.
Python is very fussy about indentation - try to run the following:
````python
print("As I was going out one day")
  print("My head fell off and rolled away,")
print("But when I saw that it was gone,")
print("I picked it up and put it on.")
````
## Predict
  1. Will the code above work?
  2. If no, why not?
  3. Type it into ``main.py`` and check your predictions.


## Exercise
1. Write a program to display your own name and address.
2. Reflect on what you have learned about Python so far. In your copy write *3 things* that Python _likes_ and *3 things* that Python does not like.
