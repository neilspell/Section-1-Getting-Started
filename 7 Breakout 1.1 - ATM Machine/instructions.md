  ## Suggested Activities
1. Key in the program above and:
  - make some changes to the program (e.g. add/remove/edit a menu option)
  - discuss traditional console menus vs. [GUI/touch screen](https://www.walkme.com/glossary/gui/#:~:text=GUI%20examples%20include%20computer%20monitors,pointing%20devices%20on%20the%20screen.) interfaces 
  - discuss possible logic behind the options
  - Add comments to describe what various lines of code are doing
    
2. Design and implement a menu for some other application of your choice e.g. what are the options on your favourite app? What additional options would you like? (For this exercise it is useful to think of a system from an end-userâ€™s perspective.)
