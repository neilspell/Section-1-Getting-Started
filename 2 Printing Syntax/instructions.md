# Instructions  

Python is not too fussy about what you type inside quotation marks. Outside quotation marks, Python is very limited in what it understands. One thing Python understands outside quotation marks is number. 
Numbers do not have to be enclosed inside quotations.

Each of the following lines are syntactically correct. 

Try them in ``main.py``
